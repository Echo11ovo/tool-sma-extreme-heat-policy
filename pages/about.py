# Sports and Medicine Australia - Extreme Heat Policy

## Scope
This website in its current form provides recommendations for the most popular sports played in 
Australia as defined in the [Extreme Heat Policy v1.0 2021](https://www.baseballnsw.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sma-extreme-heat-policy-2021-final.pdf), 
[issued by Sport Medicine Australia](https://sma.org.au/sma-unveils-new-extreme-heat-policy/). 

## Introduction
The [2021 SMA Extreme Heat Policy](https://sma.org.au/sma-site-content/uploads/2021/02/SMA-Extreme-Heat-Policy-2021-Final.pdf) 
utilises the latest published research evidence to inform:
 * a biophysical model for predicting heat stress risk; 
 * recommended cooling strategies that can be used to optimally mitigate heat stress risk. 
 
The new policy also adopts a continuous
approach to defining heat stress risk thresholds in place of stepwise categories and covers gaps
in the previous policy for conditions that often occur in many states and territories that are very
hot (35-40ËšC) but dry (Relative humidity lower than 10%), which yield relatively low dew point temperatures yet induce
high levels of sweating and physiological strain, particularly during exercise. A broad
differentiation between the thermal effects of activity levels and clothing/equipment worn
across a range of popular sports in Australia is also provided.

## Aim
The aim of this policy is to provide evidence-based guidance for protecting the health of those
participating in sport and physical activity from the potentially ill effects of extreme heat in the
summer, while ensuring that play is not unnecessarily interrupted. As new research findings
emerge, the policy will be updated accordingly. Intended users are sporting administrators,
coaches and sports medical teams responsible for the safety and wellbeing of people engaging
in sport and physical activity in hot weather, as well as individuals wishing to manage heat
stress risk during planned training activities.
